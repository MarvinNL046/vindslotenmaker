const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How long does rehab treatment last?',
    answer: 'Treatment length varies based on individual needs and the severity of addiction. Detox typically takes 3-10 days. Inpatient residential programs range from 28 days (short-term) to 60-90 days (long-term). Research shows that treatment lasting at least 90 days produces the best outcomes. Outpatient programs usually run 8-16 weeks. Your treatment team will recommend a duration based on your specific situation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I leave treatment if I want to?',
    answer: 'In most cases, treatment is voluntary and you can leave if you choose. However, leaving early significantly increases the risk of relapse. If you feel the urge to leave, talk to your treatment team first - they can address your concerns and adjust your program if needed. Some situations (court-ordered treatment, minors, medical instability) may have different rules.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens during detox?',
    answer: 'Medical detox involves 24/7 monitoring as your body clears substances. Staff will track vital signs, provide medications to manage withdrawal symptoms (which can include anxiety, nausea, sweating, tremors, and in severe cases, seizures), ensure proper nutrition and hydration, and provide emotional support. The process varies by substance but typically lasts 3-10 days. Detox addresses physical dependence but is just the first step - comprehensive treatment follows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I have access to my phone?',
    answer: 'Policies vary by facility. Many inpatient programs restrict phone and electronic use, especially during the first weeks, to help you focus on recovery without outside distractions. Some facilities allow scheduled phone calls with approved contacts. Outpatient programs typically do not restrict phone use. Ask the facility about their specific policy before admission.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can my family visit me during treatment?',
    answer: 'Most facilities encourage family involvement and have designated visiting hours, typically on weekends. Many programs also include family therapy sessions and family education programs. Some facilities restrict visitors during the initial adjustment period (first 1-2 weeks). Family members may need to be pre-approved. Contact the facility for their specific visitation policy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a typical day like in rehab?',
    answer: 'Days are structured with a mix of therapy, education, and activities. A typical day includes: wake-up and breakfast, morning meditation or yoga, group therapy, individual counseling, educational workshops, lunch, recreation or exercise, specialty groups, dinner, evening support meetings, and personal time before lights out. The structured schedule helps establish healthy routines and keeps you engaged in recovery.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What therapies are used in addiction treatment?',
    answer: 'Evidence-based therapies commonly used include: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to change negative thought patterns, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for emotion regulation, Motivational Interviewing to build commitment to change, Group Therapy for peer support, Family Therapy to repair relationships, and trauma-informed approaches like EMDR. Many facilities also offer holistic therapies such as yoga, meditation, art therapy, and equine therapy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I pack for rehab?',
    answer: 'Bring comfortable, modest clothing for about a week, basic toiletries (no alcohol-based products), any prescription medications with documentation, your ID and insurance cards, a journal, and photos of loved ones. Do NOT bring: any substances, weapons, valuables, revealing clothing, or large amounts of cash. Many facilities restrict electronics. Contact the facility for their specific packing list before arrival.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after I complete treatment?',
    answer: 'Treatment continues after inpatient care through aftercare planning. Your team will help arrange: step-down to outpatient treatment, connections to local support groups (AA, NA, SMART Recovery), sober living housing if needed, ongoing individual therapy, medication management if applicable, and employment or educational resources. A strong aftercare plan is crucial for maintaining long-term sobriety.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will treatment be confidential?',
    answer: 'Yes. Federal law (42 CFR Part 2) provides special protections for substance abuse treatment records, which are stronger than standard HIPAA protections. Your treatment cannot be disclosed to employers, law enforcement, or others without your written consent, with very limited exceptions. Facilities take confidentiality seriously to ensure you can focus on recovery without fear.',
