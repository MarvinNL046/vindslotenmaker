    question: 'Who is eligible for VA addiction treatment?',
    answer: 'Eligibility for VA addiction treatment includes veterans who served on active duty, members of Reserve and National Guard with qualifying service, and some former service members with other-than-honorable discharges who can apply for a Character of Discharge review. You do not need to have a service-connected condition to receive addiction treatment through VA.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of addiction treatment does the VA offer?',
    answer: 'The VA offers a full continuum of addiction treatment including medical detoxification, inpatient residential treatment, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), regular outpatient counseling, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid and alcohol addiction, and specialized programs for co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is VA addiction treatment free?',
    answer: 'Many veterans qualify for no-cost addiction treatment through VA. Copays depend on your priority group and income. Veterans with service-connected conditions, those who are indigent, or those who received a Purple Heart often qualify for free care. Contact your local VA to determine your copay status.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get treatment for both PTSD and addiction at the same time?',
    answer: 'Yes, the VA offers specialized dual-diagnosis programs that treat PTSD and substance use disorders simultaneously. Research shows that treating both conditions together leads to better outcomes. Ask about integrated treatment programs at your VA medical center.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I received an other-than-honorable discharge?',
    answer: 'Veterans with other-than-honorable (OTH) discharges may still be eligible for VA mental health and addiction services. You can apply for a Character of Discharge review. Additionally, the VA has expanded access for veterans in crisis. Contact the Veterans Crisis Line at 988 (press 1) for immediate help regardless of discharge status.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use VA benefits at a private treatment center?',
    answer: 'Yes, through the VA Community Care program, you may be able to receive addiction treatment at a private facility if VA services are not available within specific wait time or distance standards. Your VA provider can help determine if you qualify for Community Care.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does VA offer medication-assisted treatment (MAT)?',
    answer: 'Yes, VA provides comprehensive medication-assisted treatment for opioid and alcohol use disorders. This includes medications like buprenorphine (Suboxone), naltrexone (Vivitrol), and methadone, combined with counseling and behavioral therapies for a whole-patient approach.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What support is available for veterans families?',
    answer: 'VA offers family support services including family therapy, education about addiction, and support groups. Through CHAMPVA, some family members of disabled veterans may also have access to their own mental health services. Vet Centers also provide family counseling.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long are VA addiction treatment programs?',
    answer: 'Treatment length varies based on individual needs. Detox typically lasts 3-7 days. Inpatient residential programs range from 21-90 days. Intensive outpatient programs usually run 8-12 weeks. Ongoing outpatient support and aftercare are available indefinitely.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a Vet Center and how is it different from a VA Medical Center?',
    answer: 'Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers that provide readjustment counseling, including substance abuse assessment and referral. They offer a more informal, peer-focused environment and are available to combat veterans, drone crews, and military sexual trauma survivors regardless of VA enrollment.',
