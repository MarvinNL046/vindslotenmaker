// FAQ items for this page
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between inpatient and outpatient treatment?',
    answer: 'Inpatient (residential) treatment requires living at the facility 24/7 for intensive care, typically 30-90 days. It provides structured environment, medical supervision, and removes you from triggering environments. Outpatient treatment allows you to live at home while attending therapy sessions several times per week. Outpatient is often used after inpatient or for those with less severe addictions and strong support systems.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does addiction treatment typically last?',
    answer: 'Treatment duration varies based on individual needs and severity of addiction. Detox typically lasts 5-10 days. Inpatient programs commonly run 30, 60, or 90 days. Outpatient programs can last 3-6 months or longer. Research shows longer treatment durations (90+ days) produce better long-term outcomes. Many people continue aftercare and support groups for years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is dual diagnosis treatment?',
    answer: 'Dual diagnosis treatment addresses both addiction and co-occurring mental health disorders simultaneously. Many people with substance use disorders also struggle with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or bipolar disorder. Integrated treatment programs treat both conditions together, recognizing they often influence each other. This comprehensive approach leads to better recovery outcomes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does insurance cover addiction treatment?',
    answer: 'Most health insurance plans cover addiction treatment services thanks to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Coverage varies by plan but typically includes detox, inpatient rehab, outpatient therapy, and medication-assisted treatment. Many facilities accept multiple insurance providers. Contact facilities directly to verify your specific coverage and out-of-pocket costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is medication-assisted treatment (MAT)?',
    answer: 'MAT combines FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies for substance use disorders. Common medications include methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone for opioid addiction, and naltrexone or acamprosate for alcohol use disorder. MAT is proven effective for reducing cravings, preventing relapse, and supporting long-term recovery.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens in a sober living home?',
    answer: 'Sober living homes provide structured, alcohol and drug-free housing for people in recovery. Residents typically have completed primary treatment and need transitional support before fully independent living. Rules include maintaining sobriety, attending meetings, paying rent, completing chores, and following house guidelines. Many residents work or attend school while living there.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there treatment programs specifically for veterans?',
    answer: 'Yes, many facilities offer specialized programs for military veterans addressing combat trauma, PTSD, and military sexual trauma alongside addiction. The VA also provides addiction treatment services through VA medical centers. Specialized veteran programs understand military culture and the unique challenges veterans face in recovery.',
  },

              Inpatient vs Outpatient Treatment
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The fundamental distinction in treatment types is between inpatient (residential) and outpatient programs. This
              classification affects everything from treatment intensity and duration to daily structure and cost.
              Understanding this difference is key to choosing the right level of care.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Inpatient Rehabilitation</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Inpatient (residential) treatment provides 24/7 care in a structured facility environment. Patients
              live on-site for the duration of treatment, typically 30, 60, or 90 days. This intensive level of
              care includes medical supervision, individual therapy, group counseling, and structured activities
              designed to support recovery.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Inpatient rehab is recommended for severe addictions, those with co-occurring mental health disorders,
              people who have tried outpatient treatment without success, or anyone whose home environment poses
              risks to recovery. The residential setting removes patients from triggering environments and provides
              constant support during early recovery.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Outpatient Treatment</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Outpatient programs allow individuals to continue living at home while attending therapy sessions
              several times per week. Programs range from intensive outpatient (IOP) with 9-20 hours per week to
              standard outpatient with fewer weekly hours. This flexibility allows people to maintain work, school,
              and family responsibilities during treatment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Outpatient treatment works best for those with less severe addictions, strong support systems at home,
              stable living situations, and high motivation for recovery. Many people transition to outpatient care
              after completing inpatient treatment as a step-down level of care.

              Detox centers provide medical supervision during the withdrawal process when stopping substance use.
              Withdrawal can be dangerous or even life-threatening for certain substances like alcohol and
              benzodiazepines. Medical detox offers 24/7 monitoring, medication management, and interventions to
              ensure safe and comfortable withdrawal.

            <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Medical Detoxification</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Medical detox typically lasts 5-10 days and includes physician oversight, nursing care, and
              medications to manage withdrawal symptoms. Common medications include benzodiazepines for alcohol
              withdrawal, buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal, and various supportive medications for symptom relief.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Medication-Assisted Treatment</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) combines FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral
              therapies. MAT is highly effective for opioid and alcohol use disorders. Medications include methadone,
              buprenorphine, and naltrexone for opioid addiction, and naltrexone and acamprosate for alcohol use disorder.
              MAT helps reduce cravings, prevent relapse, and support long-term recovery.

              Dual diagnosis programs treat co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders simultaneously.
              Many people struggling with addiction also have depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, or other
              mental health conditions. Integrated treatment addresses both conditions together, recognizing how
              they influence each other and leading to better long-term outcomes.

              Specialized veteran programs address combat trauma, PTSD, military sexual trauma, and other issues
              unique to military service alongside addiction treatment. These programs understand military culture
              and the unique challenges veterans face. The VA also provides addiction treatment through VA medical

              Residents typically have completed primary treatment and need continued support while rebuilding
              their lives. Rules include maintaining sobriety, attending 12-step or support meetings, paying rent,
              completing household chores, and following house guidelines. Many residents work or attend school
              while living in sober housing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The length of stay varies from a few months to over a year, depending on individual needs and
